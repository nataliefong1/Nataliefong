        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I graduated from American High School in Fremont, in the Bay area up in north california. I attended that school from August 2017 to June 2022. My overall GPA that I got throughout my whole high school year was a 3.7. Now, after I graduated, I am attending college at UC Riverside as a freshman. I am almost done with my first year here. Some of the skills are that I can speak and understand Cantonese, Mandarin, and English fluently. I used to play a few instruments like piano, cello, clarinet, flute. I will always be willing to help and learn new things wherever I am and go so I consider myself a pretty good helper. I am also a good listener that can follow and learn things quickly as I am told to do anything. I will always try my best to be helpful and finish all my tasks quickly and efficiently. I am friendly and willing to work together with people. I am organized, have a positive attitude towards many things, and willing to help and relate to others when they need someone.  <br><br>

        Throughout my high school, I spent a lot of time volunteering at places. The first place that I went to volunteer at was the library. When I was a freshman in high school from 2017 to 2018, I volunteered at the Newark Library. During that time I would go there every Wednesday for 2 hours every week for 41 weeks to read with kids ages ranging from kindergarten to 6th grade. At this library, I joined a program which allows me to help kids ages from 5-15 to improve their reading and comprehending skills with a 30 minute one on one reading session every week. The kids range from not knowing English to just wanting to read with someone but the improvement they show gives me a sense of accomplishment in helping them. After that one year volunteering at the library, there was a Salvation Army that I also went to and volunteered there for 3 years which was basically the rest of my high school time. At the Salvation Army, I went there from 2018 to 2021. They had many programs at different times of the year and on average I would spend around 4 hours per week there and 16 weeks per year. <br><br>

        At the Salvation Army I was teamed up with other volunteers to organize lessons to teach our students how to play basic piano notes and pieces, create art works, learn how to make food, and learn the nutrients facts about the food they are eating. After a few years, I was able to take the lessons and create a program myself for the organization. After being there for 4 years, my supervisor wanted me to stay for summer and work there with her since I knew how everything worked. So from June 2022 to August 2022, they hired me to become a teacher for some classes along with being an event assistance, where I have to organize all the events we have and assign a work schedule for the other 20 volunteers that are assisting me. I had to come up with games to play with the kids there and sometimes I had to lead everyone according to the schedule that my supervisor assigned me. It was a lot of pressure but it was very fun and exciting for me to learn more leadership skills as I continued to work there over the summer.
